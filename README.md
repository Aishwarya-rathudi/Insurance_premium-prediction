## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a **predictive machine learning model** to estimate **insurance premiums** based on customer attributes. By applying **ML models, MLOps practices, and data visualization**, the system ensures accurate, efficient, and reproducible predictions that can support better decision-making in the insurance industry.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 Develop predictive models using **Scikit-learn** for insurance premium estimation
  
- 🛠 Perform **data preprocessing** with Pandas & NumPy for quality and integrity
  
- 📊 Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover key insights
  
- 📈 Create **visualizations** using Matplotlib & Seaborn for clear communication
  
- ⚡ Implement **MLOps practices** with CI/CD pipelines and **DVC** for reproducibility and streamlined deployment  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
   
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
- **MLOps Tools:** DVC (Data Version Control), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends, correlations, and outliers
   
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selecting important features influencing premium amounts
   
4. **Model Training** – Applied regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
   
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compared models using R², MAE, and RMSE
    
6. **Deployment** – Integrated CI/CD pipelines with DVC for experiment tracking and reproducibility
